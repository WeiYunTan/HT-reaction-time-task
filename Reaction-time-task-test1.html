        4. end of practice trial page start of first block. Press spacebar to proceed 
        5. First block of trials. 10 runs 
        6. show the fictitious points gained by participant : 58 points
        7. intermission screen. Shows the current 58 points. Need to gain 100 to have the money reward 
        7a. possibly see if I can do a delay of 1 minute then move on to the next screen
        8. start of second trial. Press spacebar to proceed.
        9. Second trial block. 10 runs 
        10. End of second trial. show fictitious points participant has: 26 points
        11. Then this is where I need to see if can go back to qualtrics with the next button from qualtrics.  

      For the full code, will have to do 5 practice trial, then 10 first block,
      then a point score
      Then a break screen
      Then second block
      then final screen
